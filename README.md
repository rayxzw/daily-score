# daily-score
Let's say you have a decision between a good choice and a bad choice.

If you choose the good choice, your daily total increases by 1.
If you choose the bad choice, your daily total decreases by 1.

Your score is calculated at the end of the day. It is your daily total divided by the total number of choices you had to make.

What's your score?
